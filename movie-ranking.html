 <h2>The best films I have seen that released in 2024</h2>
 <hr />

  <h3>Dune: Part 2</h3>
   <p>Phenomenal sequel that went above and beyond the hype surrounding it. Everything came together brilliantly and my personal experience in 4DX elevated the film to a higher level</p>

  <h3>Haikyu</h3>
   <p>Perfect adaptation.</p>

  <h3>The Wild Robot</h3>
   <p>Infectious joy to begin with, and sadness to end it.</p>
